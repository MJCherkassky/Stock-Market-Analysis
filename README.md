# The VBA of Wall Street

## Background
For this project I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

The script  will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  The ticker symbol.

  Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, highlighting positive and negative change with conditional formatting.

  The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, also with conditional formatting.

  The total stock volume of the stock.
  
  Script return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
